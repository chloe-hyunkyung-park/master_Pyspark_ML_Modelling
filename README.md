Introduction
Searching for exotic particles in high-energy physics
● To use supervised classification algorithms to identify Higgs bosons from particle
collisions, like the ones produced in the Large Hadron Collider.

● Data set
○ HIGGS dataset. 2.6GB.

● Description of data set
○ The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first 21
features (columns 2-22) are kinematic properties measured by the particle
detectors in the accelerator. The last seven features are functions of the
first 21 features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help
discriminate between the two classes.
